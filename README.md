# ServiceLayer
Spring Boot Service Layer Example


Copied the HelloSpring Project and created a new package (com.cpp.HelloSpring.service) which is going to be used as Service Layer and in this package, I've
created a new interface (PersonService.java) and a new class (PersonService.java) which is going to be used as implementation class.
